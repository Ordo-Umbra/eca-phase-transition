# Phase Transition in Topological Protection of Elementary Cellular Automata

**Devon Birch** | September 2025

## Discovery

Sharp phase transition in elementary cellular automata (ECA) at activity parameter λ ≈ 0.18, revealed through exhaustive analysis of all 256 binary rules.

### Key Findings

- **Critical transition**: λ = 0.178 ± 0.003 (Mann-Whitney p < 0.0001, >4σ effect size)
- **Below threshold**: 76.2% of rules exhibit rigid topological protection (stable domain walls)
- **Above threshold**: Protection drops to ~25%, despite preserved Z₂ parity (mean deviation 0.434)
- **Reversible rules**: Cluster at phase boundaries, acting as natural criticality probes
- **Universal bound**: Sub-luminal velocity constraint v < 1.2 across all regimes

## Extension to Higher States

Analysis extended to ternary (q=3, 2187 rules) and quaternary (q=4, 10k sample) totalistic CA:
- Reveals constraint-dependent "valley" structures
- Inverted correlation (λ vs variance = -0.006) compared to binary (+0.82)
- Demonstrates how totalistic constraints bifurcate dynamics for q>2
